<strong>What drumming taught me about leading a data science
team</strong>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
This talk provides practical tips on how to lead a data science team by
drawing an analogy between the role of a drummer in a band and a team
leader. While drummers don’t create the main value of a song (the
melody) and they rarely ‘lead’ bands the way lead singers or guitarists
do, they are always their band’s backbone because they set and keep time
for others to follow. Similarly, good data science leaders use best
agile practices to set the rhythm of internal processes of working with
data. Moreover, they do everything they can to maintain the rhythm of
work and, when other team members miss a beat, to improvise accordingly.
Finally, they remember their place is at the back of the band, so that
others have the freedom to explore the data in whichever way they think
creates most value.
